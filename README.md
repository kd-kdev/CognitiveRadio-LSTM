# Prediction of Channel States Using an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) Model

Using PyTorch technology, we simulate multiple frequency channels as well as their availability over time. An LSTM model that we train on the synthetic data set is used to make predictions about the future states of the spectrum based on its previous states.
